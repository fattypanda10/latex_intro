# LaTeX

LaTeX is a document preparation system  particularly well suited for
typesetting scientific texts, papers and reports.  LaTeX is ideal for
producing structured documents containing
(complex) mathematical expressions, tables, figures, etc.
This introduction will teach how to use an editor (TeXstudio) and
create, compile and print a basic LaTeX document.
We will learn how to structure the document, add tables, figures, etc.
The different topics will be demonstrated with small examples and
pointers to more advanced features will be given.
